##These are all the codes I wrote in my research in natural gradient descent algorithm.

##The codes may be a little messy because I haven't got the chance to make them tidy yet. 

##Gradient.py is a module I wrote that contains all the functions needed to do standard gradient descent and Euclidean and Wasserstein Natural Gradient descent in n-mixture Gaussian model.

##discretization.ipynb is the draft I wrote when trying to figure out how to discretize the divergence operator.

##Lorenz_system.ipynb is where I implement our algorithms and methods to Lorenz system.
